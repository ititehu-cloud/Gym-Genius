/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all personal data.
 * Each user can only access and manage their own information. Data intended for public
 * consumption, such as gym membership plans, is readable by anyone but writable only by
 * backend processes (i.e., blocked for all client-side users).
 *
 * Data Structure: A flat, collection-based structure is used to promote security and
 * query performance.
 * - /users/{userId}: Contains private member profile data, secured by user ID.
 * - /attendance/{attendanceId}: Contains individual attendance records.
 * - /payments/{paymentId}: Contains individual payment records.
 * - /plans/{planId}: Contains publicly readable membership plan details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: Users are strictly isolated. They cannot read, list, or modify the
 *   data of any other user. The rule `allow list: if false;` on the `/users` collection
 *   is critical to prevent enumeration of all gym members.
 * - Deny All by Default: The default security posture is to deny all access. Rules
 *   explicitly grant permissions on a per-collection basis.
 * - Protection of Private Collections: The `/attendance` and `/payments` collections
 *   contain sensitive user information. Listing these entire collections is disabled
 *   to prevent data leaks. Access to individual documents is granted only if the
 *   requesting user's ID matches the `memberId` field on the document.
 * - Immutable Ownership: Once a document is created (e.g., a user profile or an
 *   attendance record), its core ownership link (the `id` in a user profile or the
 *   `memberId` in a related record) cannot be changed. This prevents records from
 *   being maliciously reassigned to other users.
 * - Safe Deletes: Users are not permitted to delete their own `/users/{userId}` document
 *   to prevent accidental data loss or orphaned records. Deletions should be handled

 *   by a trusted backend process.
